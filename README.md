Mondealy UDP ASL script

To use this script you need a special version of the game from the `livesplit` branch.

Set the following launch parameters: `--livesplit-udp-url 127.0.0.1`

The timer is automatically started as soon as the prologue room starts and the menu room ends.

The splits are automatically performed during chapter changes *and* when the last dialogue with Riley ends (but before Kai walks to the center).

The timer is automatically reset when you exit to the main menu.
